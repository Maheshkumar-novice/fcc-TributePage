          <li><strong>Birth: </strong>Feb 24, 1955</li>

          <li><strong>Death: </strong>Oct 5, 2011</li>

            <strong>Early Life: </strong> Growing up, Steve Jobs had a hard time
            with formal schooling (due to boredom) and often had to be bribed to
            do his work. He was a college dropout. One of Jobs' first jobs was
            with Atari as a video game designer.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1976: </strong> Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computers with
            Steve Wozniak.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1985: </strong> He left Apple and launched Pixar Animation
            Studios.
          </li>

          <li><strong>1997: </strong>Returned as CEO to Apple again.</li>

          <li>Under his reign, Apple launched the iPod and iPhone.</li>

          <li>
            If Jobs had not sold his Apple shares in 1985, when he left the
            company he founded for over a decade, his net worth would have been
            a staggering $36 billion.
          </li>
